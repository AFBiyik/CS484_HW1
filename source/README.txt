=========================================================
Code in "question_b.m" and "question_c.m" requires image data.
Extract files in the image data that shared on course page 
(http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~saksoy/courses/cs484-Fall2019/src/cs484_hw1_data.tar.gz)
OUTSIDE of source folder or change "dataPath" variable in 
"question_b.m" and "question_c.m" files to execute code in these files.

=========================================================
Image output is written in a directory named output when code runs.
If this directory does not exists, code creates this directory.
If code gives an error due to creating directory, check file permissions.
